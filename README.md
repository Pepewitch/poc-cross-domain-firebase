# PoC Cross Domain Firebase

This project is a PoC for signing in on a website with Firebase Auth and providing credential for the other authorized sites.

### Testing Domains
- First domain: https://poc-cross-domain-firebase.anypoc.app
- Second domain: https://poc-cross-domain-firebase2.anypoc.app
- API: https://poc-cross-domain-api.anypoc.app

### Expected behavior
Users should be able to sign in on the first domain. After that when users visit second domain, it should show that users have signed in with the same email as it shown in the first domain.
